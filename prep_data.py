%This file will generate real(not complex) toy data
% Experiment 1
% Suppose there are 3 classes, the vj is given, 6 Chennels with real "steer vector"
% vj shape of 50*50, the component sources have variation of AOA and power 
% all the x(n,f) the stft is real number
% 1. try Duang's method
% 2. try neural EM with 3 networks

% Experiment 2
% Suppose there are 3 classes, AOA and power are given
% there are variation of vj in each class
% try neural EM with 3 networks to see how \gamma_j works
